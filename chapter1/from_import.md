# PEP8 module import guideline
- put the import statement(includes from x import y) at the top of file
- do prefer to use 'from bar import foo' instead of just 'import foo'
- In case of relative path, use 'from . import foo'
- Separate and place modules in the order of '[standard, third party, custom]'
