# Expression and Statement in python
- 'if a is not b' is better than 'if not a is b'
- use 'if not container' or 'if not sequence' instead of 'if len(something) == 0' (when checking [], '')
- use 'if container' or 'if sequence' instead of 'if len(something) > 0'
- when using 'if' and 'while' and etc, split the linses for clarity (use multi lines)
- if couldn't express one line, wrap the expression and use indent/another line
- do prefer to use '()' instead of '\' in multi lines
